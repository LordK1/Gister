### What the hell is going on Dagger 2 ?!? 
1. Dagger 2 API

Dagger 2 exposes a number of special annotations:

    @Module for the classes whose methods provide dependencies
    @Provides for the methods within @Module classes
    @Inject to request a dependency (a constructor, a field, or a method)
    @Component is a bridge interface between modules and injection

### Cautions 
Please notice this is open source project to make self learning for Android Development Enthusiastic.
You can find more information, sources, references in [References](#112) .
Be patient, and read everything.
I really appreciate Github for making great free REST Api, You could find more it's documents in this [link] (https://developer.github.com/v3/).
##### At last during this simple application I just try to learn deeper and deeper, but now I think I've shallow experience about whole these concerns.
